        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Everyone needs a great Spaghetti Bolognese recipe, and this is the one for you! The Bolognese Sauce is rich, thick and has beautiful depth of flavour. It’s perfect for a quick midweek meal though if you have the time to simmer this Meat Sauce for a couple of hours, you’ll take it from seriously delish to <em>OMG this is amazing!</em></p>
            <p>The Spaghetti Bolognese, or as we Aussies like to call it, <em>spag bol</em> is a dish that can be served  over pasta, stuff into jacket potatoes, make an epic Lasagna or Baked Spaghetti Pie!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 1/2 tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>2 garlic cloves <em>(minced)</em></li>
                <li>1 onion <em>(finely chopped, brown, yellow or white)</em></li>
                <li>500g beef mince <em>(or half pork, half beef)</em></li>
                <li>1/2 cup (125 ml) dry red wine <em>(sub water or beef broth/stock)</em></li>
                <li>2 beef bouillon cubes <em>(crumbled or granulated beef bouillon)</em></li>
                <li>800g can crushed tomato <em>(or tomato passata)</em></li>
                <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
                <li>2 tsp white sugar</li>
                <li>2 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>2 dried bay leaves</li>
                <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme <em>(or 1/2 tsp dried thyme or oregano)</em></li>
                <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>To Serve</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>400g spaghetti <em>(dried)</em></li>
                <li>Parmesan cheese <em>(and finely chopped parsely - optional)</em></li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic, cook for 3 minutes or until light golden and softened.</li>
                <li>Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook, breaking it up as your go, until browned.</li>
                <li>Add red wine. Bring to simmer and cook for 1 minute, scraping the bottom of the pot, until the alchol smell is gone.</li>
                <li>Add remaining ingredients except salt and pepper. Stir, bring to a simmer then turn down to medium so it bubbles gently. Cook for 20-30 minutes (no lid), adding water if the sauce gets too thick for your taste. Stir occasionally.</li>
                <li><strong>Slow simmper option:</strong> really takes this to another level, if you have the time! Add 3/4 cup of water, cover with lid and simmer on very low for 2-2.5 hours, stirring every 30 minutes or so. (Note 5) Uncover, simmer 20 minutes to thicken sauce.</li>
                <li>Adjust salt and pepper to taste right at the end. Serve over spaghetti - though if you have the time, I recommend tossing the sauce and pasta per steps below.</li>
            </ol>
        <h4>Tossing Sauce and Spaghetti <em>(optional)</em></h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add pasta and cook per packet directions MINUS 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Scoop out a mug of pasta cooking water and set aside, then drain the pasta.</li>
                <li>Add pasta into the bolognese sauce with about 1/2 cup (125 ml) of reserved pasta water over medium heat. Toss gently for 1 1/2-2 minutes, or until the spaghetti turns red and the sauce thickens.</li>
                <li>Divide between bowls. Garnish with parmesan and parsley if desired.</li>
            </ol>
